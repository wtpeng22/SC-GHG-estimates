# SC-GHG estimates
 Estimating the social cost of greenhouse gases
 
 We randomly combined three simple climate models (FAIR, Hector, MAGICC) and seven damage models (D-FUND, D-PAGE, D-DICE, D-HS, BHM-lag0, BHM-lag5, DJO) to produce a set of 21  climate-economy models to estimate SC-GHG.
 
 The codes to estimate SC-GHG are listed in the "Compute_SC_GHG" file, and the modules included are listed in the "Module" file.
 
 All the codes are written in R.
